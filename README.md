# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to examine a CSV of over 34,000 businesses containing a number of descriptive features including funding amounts and whether or not those businesses ultimately succeeded, and to use neural networking in order to try and predict the likelihood of new businesses failing, in a bid to try and prevent lost investments.

## Analysis

### Data Preprocessing

- The target for this model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column in the "charity_data.csv" file. Because it is binary, with a 0 meaning no success and a 1 meaning success, it's simple to try and predict.
